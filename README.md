Goed is a library written in Go, designed for calculating the edit distance (Levenshtein distance) across various data structures including strings, trees, and graphs. For each of these data structures, Goed offers both a sequential and a parallel version, allowing users to choose the most suitable approach based on their specific requirements and computational resources.
